            <h2>Walk to Win: Gamifying Pedestrian Life on Longtan Road</h2>
            <p>In Yunlin County's Douliu City, Longtan Road serves as a crucial transportation hub, but the persistent issue of chaotic street traffic has been a concern for pedestrians. To address this problem, my team and I developed an app to optimize the traffic conditions on Longtan Road.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Overview</h2>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Identified traffic issues and their sources on Longtan Road.</li>
                <li>Implemented solutions to improve traffic conditions on Longtan Road.</li>
                <li>Provided long-term solutions for sustainable improvement.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Core Team</h3>
            <p>Three students from National Yunlin University of Science & Technology Department of Cultural Heritage Conservation and Department of Creative Design.</p>

            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>UX/UI Design</li>
                <li>Research and Synthesis</li>
                <li>Prototype</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Background</h2>
            <p>Longtan Road, known for its food stalls and heavy traffic, experiences significant congestion—especially during school rush hours—due to an over-reliance on motorcycles. Our project addresses this by promoting walking as a viable and rewarding alternative.</p>
            <p><strong>The Longtan Walker Pace Counter APP</strong> is a mobile solution designed to gamify pedestrian movement, encouraging students and residents to choose walking over driving for short distances.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Problem Statement</h2>
            <p>Surveys and observational studies revealed that over <strong>70%</strong> of students in the Longtan area commute via motorcycle, despite the walkability of the region.</p>
            <p>This leads to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Increased congestion</li>
                <li>Safety concerns for pedestrians</li>
                <li>Noise and air pollution</li>
                <li>Diminished local business engagement due to inaccessible foot traffic</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Target Users</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>High school and university students in the Longtan area</li>
                <li>Local residents</li>
                <li>Small business owners along Longtan Road</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Investigate Finding</h2>

            <h3>The Interview Record</h3>
            <p>Our team conducted interviews with street vendors, pedestrians, and shop owners, and compiled a list of issues along Longtan Road.</p>

            <h3>Traffic Issues Caused by Motorcycles</h3>
            <p>Through street interviews with students and businesses on Longtan Road, we found that traffic issues arise during mealtimes due to congestion, poor air quality, limited parking, and safety concerns, mainly caused by the high number of motorcycles. To alleviate these problems, reducing the number of motorcycles on Longtan Road is crucial.</p>

            <h2 style="margin-top: 40px;">Solution</h2>
            <h3>Walk More, Save More!</h3>
            <p>To reduce the number of motorcycles on the road, we propose that students switch to walking on Longtan Road. To incentivize this change, we suggest offering discounts through a step-counting system. Students can accumulate steps to exchange for food discount vouchers, benefiting both students and businesses. This approach aims to address traffic issues successfully.</p>
